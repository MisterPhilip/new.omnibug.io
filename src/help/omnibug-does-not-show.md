### Problem: 

When opening the developer tools, Omnibug does not appear in the list of tabs.

### Prognosis:

This could be caused by multiple reasons:

 1. Omnibug is not enabled. Ensure that you've enabled the Omnibug in your browser's extensions page.
 1. This was a known Chromium issue, for for all extensions that use the developer tools window. This has been solved as 
 of v84, but ensure that your browser is up-to-date.
