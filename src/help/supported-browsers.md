As much as we'd love to be able to support Omnibug in every browser on the market, unfortunately the required APIs for 
us to build and use Omnibug just don't exist in all browsers. Omnibug is currently supported in all Chromium-based browsers, 
which include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, as well as Mozilla Firefox. 

Learn more about how to install Omnibug for your browser on our [installation page](/install/).
